# Execute-ScriptRemotelyAndParallely
Here are two scripts: One does the work or payload (e.g. gather information or install a program or execute a program) and one copies this script from a central place (e.g. management server) onto all network computers in your active directory and executes the payload on that machine - all of this parallely and fast.
